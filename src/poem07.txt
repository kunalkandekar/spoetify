With my destiny decided, I've booked and paid the fees.
If only i can overcome the trembling in my knees.
Arriving at the airfield, my first task is to train.
It seems a good idea prior to jumping out a plane
With self doubt all-consuming, my thoughts are turning black
Wondering, if i will be, the only one to crack?
At night I hear some stories, of goriness and blood
About unopened parachutes all ending with a thud!
I wake up bright and early, more training is in store
plus going over all the things we've learnt the day before





With my pregnant wife beside me, her strength will be my karma
If only i can prove I am her Knight in shining armour
So six of us get seated, aboard the tiny plane
I jabber on incessantly to trick my nervous brain

The plane ascends quite quickly, my poor heart skips a beat

When i hear the pilot shout, "we're at three thousand feet!"

Fate is so unkind to me, I pluck the shortest straw

The instructor looks me in the eye and opens up the door

I stand there in the doorway, checking out the scene

Wishing that my mom is here so she can intervene

Then just below the doorway, I spy a metal peg

Where i place the foot that is attached to my left leg

I stretch my right hand out, preying it will cling

To the metal pole, that is designed to hold the wing

I wonder as I'm waiting, have I left too much to chance

Knowing that i could have worn six pairs of underpants

The instructor is a tough nut, almost twice my size

With 'you ain't getting back in here', stamped between his eyes

I count down five long seconds, the instructor shouts out, go!

My wife then hears her brave Knight scream three thousand feet below

I'm tumbling round and round, like a cork flushed down a loo

Wondered if this buffeting will leave me black and blue

The Reaper isn't happy, in fact his mood is black

Knowing that the parachute has flicked him off my back

With the terror fast receding, the view is so sublime

if heaven's only half this good, I'm getting in the line

I'm floating nice and slowly, gazing all around

Hoping that it takes a while to land down on the ground

I'm glad some bloke's invented, a system really cute

Strings to pull above one's head to steer the parachute

I'm flying like a bird, feeling full of zest

Sometimes North or South, sometimes East or West

An instructor down below, has an arrow he turns round

To guide my chute into the wind to get me on the ground

The earth is getting closer, I'm feeling rather prone

Then the fellow with the arrow plonks me in the landing zone

The grass is getting nearer, my feet touch on the ground

No thud to finish off this tale, I've landed safe and sound

So if you seek adventure, please take my advice

It isn't all that scary, as I'm about to do it twice?
